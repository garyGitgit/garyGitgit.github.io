# **About Me**

## **Introduction** 
<br>
Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** (Sangwoo Noh). <br><br>
I'm currently working in **Samsung Electronics** as a **software engineer**. <br>
My main job is to develop automation software for SoC ([Exynos](https://www.samsung.com/semiconductor/minisite/exynos/)) [design verification](https://garygitgit.github.io/blog/soc-verification). <br>
I also work for improving SoC design verification with data analytics and machine learning / deep learning. <br>
Even if I mostly use Python to work on those jobs, I have some experiences on developing websites and Android application, version control with git and github, developing a server program with Django.<br><br>
My main interest is SoC, machine learning / deep learning, data analytics, plus coding education and mobile healthcare. <br><br>
