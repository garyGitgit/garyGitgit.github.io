SoC (System On Chip) design verification is a process that a hardware (physical) design works correctly in a variety of scenarios. It is also a process of finding out a bug hiding in the hardware design. <br>

## Overall Flow
![overall flow](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=19uEBxrxZEhszDdGEZ_lvyWdA-YFsaQnR) <br>
1. Design: SoC design flow is a process of creating a physical design and architecture. This stage includes C modeling and hardware design with HDL (Hardware Description Language).  <br>
2. Verification: <br>
  (1) IP / Block: IP (Intellectual Property) and block is a basic component in SoC. Tests for each IP and block are performed in this stage.<br>
  (2) SoC: SoC is integrated IPs and blocks. Full tests are performed in this stage.<br>
3. Tape out: This stage is a process of producing the chip from the factory. <br>
4. Software development <br>
  (1) Software development and validation: Software that enables the chip is developed in this stage. It includes setting tuning parameters for the chip, developing software working on the chip, etc.<br>
  (2) System integration: Both hardware chip and software are integrated in this stage.<br>
