## Overview
Golang was made by Google to take some of features that other languages, such as Java, C++ and Python, don't have. <br/>
- See [official website](https://golang.org/).
- See [community](https://golang.org/conduct).

## Features
- Simplicity
- Fast compile time
- Garbage collected
- Built-in concurrency
- Compile to standalone binaries

#### Simplicity

#### Fast compile time
Traditional languages, such as C and C++, are compiled by GCC compiler, which have relatively low compile time. However, Go doesn't. It has faster compile time. 

#### Garbage collected
Traditional languages, such as Java, have Garbage Collection (GC) function to manage memory resources. This function sometimes make the program slow. However, Go has fast GC function, and it makes users unaware of GC while running programs.

#### Built-in concurrency
One of the powerful function of Go is concurrency. As a number of programs require concurrency functions, Go supports built-in concurrency function, enabling developers to easily work on concurrency programming.

#### Compile to standalone binaries
